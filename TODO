Synthetic Comet
ToDo
==================================================

Pending
=======

P. Power law distribution of sizes of debris.

P. Include evaporation recoil.

P. In observations calculate brightness of coma according to
   properties and distribution of particles.

P. Calculate debris zone expansion velocity.

P. Include mass variation for particles.

P. Ephemeris of the Earth and Comet

P. Disintegration mode:

   * Purely rotational: all particles start with an initial velocity purely
     rotational

   * Rotational + Gas lifted debris: large fragments start with
     initial velocity purely rotational but debris start with an
     additional component due to gas lift.

Done
====

D. Make debris start from surface

D. Include Poynting-Robertson

D. Include mass in state vector.

D. Save trajectories individually

D. Separate trajectories according to large and debris particles

D. Calculate escape velocity from the debris zone

D. Gravitation of large fragments.

D. Include Poynting-Robertson correction.
