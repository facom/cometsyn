Synthetic Comet
ToDo
==================================================

Pending
=======

P. Include evaporation recoil.

P. In observations calculate brightness of coma according to
   properties and distribution of particles.

P. Include mass variation for particles.

P. Ephemeris of the Earth and Comet

Done
====

D. Power law distribution of sizes of debris.

D. Calculate debris zone expansion velocity.

D. Disintegration mode:

   * Purely rotational: all particles start with an initial velocity purely
     rotational

   * Rotational + Gas lifted debris: large fragments start with
     initial velocity purely rotational but debris start with an
     additional component due to gas lift.

D. Make debris start from surface

D. Include colisions and fusion of particles.

D. Include Poynting-Robertson

D. Include mass in state vector.

D. Save trajectories individually

D. Separate trajectories according to large and debris particles

D. Calculate escape velocity from the debris zone

D. Gravitation of large fragments.

D. Include Poynting-Robertson correction.
